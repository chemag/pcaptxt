.SH NAME
pcaptxt \- convert pcap (tcpdump) traces to and from text
."
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pcaptxt
[\-h] [\-d device] \-s speed
."
.SH DESCRIPTION
Modern cdrom drives are too fast. It can take several seconds
on a 60x speed cdrom drive to spin it up and read data from
the drive.  The result is that these drives are just a lot slower
than a 8x or 24x drive.  This is especially true if you are only
occasionally (e.g every 5 seconds) reading a small file. This
utility limits the speed and makes the drive more responsive
when accessing small files.
.PP
pcaptxt makes the drive also less noisy and is very useful if
you want to listen to music on your computer.
."
